## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Deferred/Pending Initiatives:**

- **Access Control Framework Implementation** (initially proposed Q1, rescheduled multiple times, currently unscheduled).
- **Dependency Management Automation** (delayed from Q2 due to resource constraints).
- **Comprehensive RBAC policy rollout** (postponed indefinitely due to lack of clear ownership).

## Strategic Considerations for Security Investments

The engineering roadmap provides critical context for security investment decisions. Security professionals should consider the following strategic approaches:

1. **Kubernetes Migration Opportunity**: The Q1 Kubernetes migration presents a unique opportunity to implement security controls as part of the infrastructure transformation rather than retrofitting them later. Security investments should prioritize:
   - Kubernetes security policies and network controls
   - Container image scanning and hardening
   - Service mesh security capabilities

2. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**: With automated deployment pipelines being implemented in Q1, security investments should focus on:
   - Integrating security scanning into CI/CD workflows
   - Implementing automated compliance checks
   - Establishing secure deployment practices

3. **Infrastructure Expansion Timing**: The planned infrastructure doubling in Q2 provides an opportunity to implement security at scale. Security investments should:
   - Ensure security controls are designed to scale with infrastructure
   - Implement security automation alongside autoscaling mechanisms
   - Establish security baselines before the expansion

4. **API Security Focus**: With Q3 objectives focused on API performance and integrations, security investments should:
   - Implement API security controls that don't impact performance targets
   - Develop security standards for third-party integrations
   - Establish monitoring for API abuse and anomalies

5. **Data Architecture Security**: The Q4 data lake refactoring presents an opportunity to address data security. Investments should:
   - Implement data classification and protection in the new architecture
   - Establish access controls for real-time analytics
   - Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations

6. **Addressing Deferred Security Initiatives**: The roadmap explicitly notes several deferred security initiatives. Security investments should:
   - Propose incremental approaches to access control that can be implemented without a full framework
   - Identify critical dependencies that require immediate security attention despite automation delays
   - Establish clear ownership for RBAC implementation

7. **Timing Considerations**:
   - Align security investments with quarterly engineering priorities
   - Front-load security investments in Q1/Q2 to establish security foundations before major feature work
   - Identify security quick wins that can be implemented alongside planned engineering work

8. **Areas to Avoid**:
   - Security initiatives that would delay the release cycle reduction
   - Complex security frameworks that require significant engineering resources during peak delivery periods
   - Security controls that would negatively impact the API response time targets

_This roadmap highlights strategic priorities, milestones, and clearly identifies gaps‚Äîparticularly around access control and security initiatives that have been repeatedly deferred._
