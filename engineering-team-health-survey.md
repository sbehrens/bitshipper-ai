# ðŸ“‹ BitShipper AI â€“ Engineering Team Health Survey (2025)

---

## ðŸ“… **Survey Date:** March 1, 2025  
**Participants:** 85% Response Rate (Engineering & Product Teams)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Overall Team Sentiment**
The survey results reflect generally positive sentiment about individual team autonomy, but highlight significant concerns around organizational clarity, security ownership, and proactive planning.

---

## ðŸ”‘ **Key Findings and Themes**


---

### ðŸ“‰ **High Stress and Reactive Work Environment**

- **62%** of engineers stated that unplanned incidents and firefighting significantly disrupt their productivity.
- Engineers noted they spend approximately **30%** of their work week reacting to outages or incidents, detracting from proactive feature development.

---

### ðŸŒ€ **Frequent Project Delays and Competing Priorities**

- **58%** of engineers reported frequent delays or cancellations of projects due to shifting business priorities.
- Major concerns included:
  - Repeatedly delayed implementation of automated testing and deployment improvements.
  - Consistently deferred initiatives, such as comprehensive RBAC implementation and dependency management.

---

### ðŸ§© **Unclear Roles and Responsibilities**

- **44%** of respondents felt that team responsibilities, especially regarding incident response and security remediation, were ambiguous or poorly communicated.
- Only **20%** feel roles and responsibilities are clearly documented and understood across teams.

---

### ðŸ•’ **Limited Long-Term Planning and Strategic Alignment**

- **52%** of engineers stated their team lacked adequate time for strategic planning or proactive improvements.
- **64%** identified a pattern of short-term fixes rather than sustainable long-term solutions.

---

### ðŸ“Œ **Engineering Team Recommendations**

- Clarify ownership and accountability around critical engineering responsibilities, notably access management.
- Prioritize long-term planning and strategic investments to reduce reactive workload.
- Implement regular, structured engineering retrospectives focused on systemic improvements rather than isolated incidents.

## Strategic Considerations for Security Investments

The engineering team health survey provides critical organizational context that should inform security investment decisions:

1. **Reactive Environment Considerations**: With 62% of engineers reporting significant disruption from firefighting activities, security investments should:
   - Prioritize automation that reduces manual security tasks
   - Focus on preventative controls that minimize security incidents
   - Implement security measures that don't add operational burden to already stressed teams

2. **Competing Priorities Impact**: Given the pattern of security initiatives being repeatedly deferred (e.g., RBAC implementation), security investments should:
   - Break large security initiatives into smaller, incremental improvements
   - Align security work with business priorities to prevent deprioritization
   - Identify security quick wins that deliver visible value with minimal effort

3. **Ownership and Accountability**: With 44% reporting unclear responsibilities around security remediation, investments should:
   - Include clear definition of security roles and responsibilities
   - Establish explicit ownership for security controls and processes
   - Implement security controls with built-in accountability mechanisms

4. **Long-term vs. Short-term Balance**: With 64% reporting a pattern of short-term fixes, security investments should:
   - Balance immediate security needs with sustainable long-term solutions
   - Include security architecture work, not just tactical fixes
   - Establish security technical debt tracking to prevent accumulation of short-term fixes

5. **Team Capacity Considerations**: Security investments must account for the current team capacity challenges:
   - Prioritize security controls that reduce, rather than increase, operational burden
   - Consider managed security services for functions that would otherwise add to team workload
   - Phase security implementations to align with team capacity

6. **Areas to Avoid**:
   - Complex security frameworks requiring significant coordination across teams with unclear responsibilities
   - Security initiatives that would add to the reactive workload without clear ownership
   - Security tools that require extensive manual operation in an already stressed environment

7. **Investment Approach**:
   - Include dedicated time for security work in sprint planning to prevent deprioritization
   - Establish clear metrics to demonstrate security improvement and justify continued investment
   - Align security investments with the engineering team recommendations for clarifying ownership and reducing reactive workload
