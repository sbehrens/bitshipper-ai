Across 7 of the 13 recent incidents (Incidents #11, #12, #17, #18, #20, #21, and #25), misconfigured IAM roles, excessive permissions, and inadequate access controls led to unauthorized actions, data exposure, and service disruptions. These failures resulted in significant downtime, regulatory risk, and customer impact. Implementing a standardized least-privilege IAM framework with automated access reviews and enforcement would have prevented these issues by ensuring that only authorized users and services have the necessary permissions. Prioritizing this control will directly reduce recurring security risks and operational disruptions.
