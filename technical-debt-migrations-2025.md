# ðŸ”§ BitShipper AI â€“ Technical Debt and Migrations (2025)

## Overview

This document outlines BitShipper AI's current technical debt landscape and planned migrations. Understanding technical debt and migration plans provides security professionals with critical context for identifying security risks and aligning security investments with technical initiatives.

## Current Technical Debt Inventory

### High-Impact Technical Debt

| Item | Description | Business Impact | Security Implications | Age |
|------|-------------|----------------|----------------------|-----|
| Legacy Authentication System | Custom-built authentication system using outdated libraries and practices | Slows feature development, causes intermittent outages | Vulnerable to session hijacking, lacks MFA support | 3 years |
| Monolithic Billing Service | Original billing codebase with minimal separation of concerns | Difficult to scale, frequent performance issues | Excessive database permissions, insufficient input validation | 2.5 years |
| Unmanaged Kubernetes Access | Ad-hoc access management for Kubernetes clusters | Deployment delays, troubleshooting challenges | No audit trail, excessive permissions, lack of least privilege | 1.5 years |
| Hardcoded Credentials | Credentials embedded in application code and configuration files | Deployment friction, environment management complexity | Credential exposure risk, inability to rotate secrets | 2 years |
| Inconsistent API Security | Different security models across API versions | Developer confusion, integration challenges | Inconsistent authorization, authentication bypasses | 2 years |

### Medium-Impact Technical Debt

| Item | Description | Business Impact | Security Implications | Age |
|------|-------------|----------------|----------------------|-----|
| Outdated Dependencies | ~30% of dependencies are at least 2 major versions behind | Increasing maintenance burden | Known vulnerabilities, lack of security patches | 1-3 years |
| Manual Deployment Processes | Partially automated deployment pipelines requiring manual steps | Deployment delays, human errors | Inconsistent security configurations, bypass of security checks | 2 years |
| Inconsistent Logging | Different logging formats and storage across services | Troubleshooting delays, incomplete monitoring | Limited detection capabilities, blind spots | 1-2 years |
| Test Coverage Gaps | Automated test coverage below 60% for core services | Regression issues, release delays | Security controls may be bypassed or broken without detection | 1-3 years |
| Configuration Sprawl | Configuration scattered across multiple systems without centralized management | Environment inconsistencies, troubleshooting challenges | Security misconfigurations, drift between environments | 2 years |

## Planned Technical Migrations

### In-Progress Migrations

| Migration | Description | Current Status | Completion Target | Security Opportunities |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Kubernetes Migration | Moving all services to Kubernetes orchestration | 60% complete | Q3 2025 | Implement pod security policies, network policies, and service mesh |
| Authentication Modernization | Replacing custom auth with OAuth 2.0/OIDC implementation | 40% complete | Q2 2025 | Add MFA, improve session management, implement proper RBAC |
| CI/CD Pipeline Standardization | Standardizing all services on GitHub Actions with security scanning | 70% complete | Q2 2025 | Integrate SAST, SCA, container scanning, and IaC scanning |
| Secrets Management | Moving from hardcoded secrets to AWS Secrets Manager | 30% complete | Q3 2025 | Implement secret rotation, access controls, and audit logging |
| Logging Centralization | Standardizing logging and centralizing in CloudWatch | 50% complete | Q2 2025 | Improve detection capabilities, implement log monitoring |

### Planned Migrations (Not Started)

| Migration | Description | Planned Start | Target Completion | Security Opportunities |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| API Gateway Consolidation | Consolidating multiple API gateways into a single solution | Q3 2025 | Q4 2025 | Standardize authentication, implement API security monitoring |
| Database Modernization | Migrating legacy databases to managed Aurora PostgreSQL | Q3 2025 | Q1 2026 | Implement encryption, access controls, and audit logging |
| Microservices Decomposition | Breaking down monolithic services into microservices | Q4 2025 | Q3 2026 | Implement service-to-service authentication, least privilege |
| Infrastructure as Code | Moving all infrastructure to Terraform | Q2 2025 | Q4 2025 | Implement security as code, automated compliance checks |
| Zero Trust Network | Implementing zero trust principles across infrastructure | Q4 2025 | Q2 2026 | Microsegmentation, identity-based access, continuous verification |

## Technical Debt Accumulation Factors (Discovered in Interviews with Engineering Managers and ICs)

### Process Factors
- **Deployment Frequency**: Bi-weekly releases create pressure to defer non-functional improvements
- **Feature Prioritization**: Business features consistently prioritized over technical improvements
- **Technical Decision Ownership**: Unclear ownership of technical decisions leads to inconsistent patterns
- **Documentation Practices**: Inconsistent documentation of technical decisions and architecture

### Organizational Factors
- **Team Structure**: Conway's Law effects with team boundaries reflected in architecture
- **Resource Allocation**: Limited dedicated capacity for technical debt reduction
- **Knowledge Silos**: Critical knowledge concentrated in few long-tenured engineers
- **Technical Leadership**: Gap in technical leadership for cross-cutting concerns

## Technical Debt Management Strategy

### Current Approach
- **Opportunistic Refactoring**: Technical debt addressed opportunistically during feature development
- **Dedicated Sprint Allocation**: 10-15% of sprint capacity allocated to technical debt reduction
- **Major Migrations**: Larger technical debt items addressed through dedicated migration projects
- **Incident-Driven Improvements**: Technical debt that contributes to incidents gets prioritized

### Effectiveness Metrics
- **Technical Debt Reduction Rate**: ~5% reduction quarter-over-quarter
- **Technical Debt Introduction Rate**: ~8% new technical debt quarter-over-quarter
- **Net Technical Debt Trend**: Increasing by ~3% quarter-over-quarter
- **Technical Debt-Related Incidents**: 35% of all incidents related to technical debt

## Strategic Implications for Security Investments

1. **Migration Alignment**: Security investments should align with planned migrations to avoid rework and maximize efficiency.

2. **Technical Debt Security Impact**: Prioritize security controls that mitigate risks from high-impact technical debt items.

3. **Secure by Design in Migrations**: Leverage migrations as opportunities to embed security improvements rather than retrofitting later.

4. **Automation Opportunities**: Focus on security automation that can be integrated into evolving CI/CD and infrastructure as code initiatives.

5. **Architectural Security Improvements**: Use microservices decomposition and API consolidation as opportunities to implement improved security architecture.

6. **Quick Wins vs. Strategic Improvements**: Balance quick security wins against longer-term architectural security improvements that align with technical debt reduction.

## Conclusion

Technical debt and migration plans provide essential context for security investment decisions. By understanding the technical landscape and planned changes, security professionals can better align security controls with the evolving architecture, leverage migration opportunities for security improvements, and address security risks associated with existing technical debt.
